# CRISPRi-functional-genomics-in-prokaryotes

This repository presents the python script collection for CRISPR interference based functional genomics study in prokaryotes, firstly demonstrated in E. coli (for the experiment description and result presentation, see https://doi.org/10.1101/129668).

The python package basically contains two subpackages, one for the sgRNA (N20) design at either customized manner (given interested gene fasta file) or genome level (given the gene fasta file encoded by particular genome), while another for the NGS data processing and result visualization after experimental screen. For the details about package usage, see the README file within each subpackage depoisited together with the scripts.
